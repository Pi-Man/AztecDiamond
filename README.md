# AztecDiamond
Program for visualizing the square dance for the Aztec Diamond featured in Mathologer's 2020 Christmas video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7Q8IWNfHM




this program was built using a custom game engine that I have been working on that I plan on releasing soon, so some of the code is hidden by that but all the logic is in main.cpp still
